Recipes.

My rendition of the inaugural project, 'Recipes,' for The Odin Project.

This endeavor focuses on HTML5 and incorporates all the skills acquired from The Odin Project, alongside my prior knowledge, to craft a fundamental recipe website.

I aim to showcase proficiency in HTML boilerplate, tag implementation, and adherence to coding best practices. Additionally, I seek to enhance my expertise in utilizing Git and GitHub through further practice and application.
