            Macaroni and cheese is a quintessential comfort food beloved for its creamy texture and indulgent flavor. This classic dish features tender elbow macaroni noodles enveloped in a rich and velvety cheese sauce. The sauce, often made from a combination of butter, flour, milk, and cheese, is meticulously crafted to achieve the perfect balance of creaminess and cheesiness.

            <h2>steps</h2>

                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a baking dish lightly with butter or non-stick cooking spray.</li>
                    <li>Cook the macaroni according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
                    <li>In a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Once melted, add the flour and whisk constantly for 1-2 minutes to create a roux, ensuring no lumps remain.</li>
                    <li>Gradually pour in the milk while whisking continuously to prevent lumps from forming. Cook the mixture, stirring frequently, until it thickens and begins to bubble, about 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Reduce the heat to low and stir in the shredded cheddar cheese until fully melted and the sauce is smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                    <li>Add the cooked macaroni to the cheese sauce, stirring until the macaroni is evenly coated.</li>
                    <li>Transfer the macaroni and cheese mixture to the prepared baking dish, spreading it out evenly.</li>
                    <li>If desired, sprinkle breadcrumbs evenly over the top for a crunchy topping. You can also add diced bacon for extra flavor.</li>
                    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly.</li>
                    <li>Once baked, remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving. Garnish with chopped parsley if desired.</li>
                    <li>Serve the classic macaroni and cheese hot as a comforting and satisfying dish for any occasion. Enjoy!</li>
